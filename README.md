Self-Assessment to Conclude Final Capstone Project

## 1 Self Assessment

Overall, I am very pleased with my performance and effort throughout this capstone project and throughout the course. I felt that I was very communicative with my team throughout this relatively unorthodox 'classroom' environment, offered ideas and suggestions, and contributed about 1/3 of the work toward the final deliverable.  

Most of my responsibilities related to this project was the initial creation of the repository - set up of the overall structure and flow of the README and designated branches for each of our team members. Then, I took sole responsibility over the construction and connection of our database. Using PGAdmin, we were able to build a connection string from jupyter notebook to our Postgres db and store our static data tables for use throughout the project. Having the database was integral to the success of the project because it contained the cleaned and current datasets required to deliver our results. Coupled with this, I was also responsible for creating our Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that illustrated relationships between the data - a necessary piece of our database creation and validity.

Finally, once our database was finalized, and all necessary tables were stored, I assisted in checking the results that we chose to present in our final project. Some deliverables for our project were being completed simultaneously at times, so it was necessary to ensure that our data was aligned and matched across all deliverables.

## 2 Team Assessment

I believe my team performed exceptionally well during this project. Originally, we started this project as a group of 4 and were notified two weeks in that 1 member needed to drop out. This split the duties of a 4-person group across 3 unexpectedly. However, we managed to work through this obstacle just fine, and I feel that our communication grew stronger once we were forced to deal with this roadblock.

## 3 Final Project Summary

For this capstone project, the Shaggy Dogs comprised of myself, Alex Stately, and Belen Lopez, focused on NYC Dog Adoptions from 2014-2016 in the 5 boroughs - Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The data that we used was derived from Kaggle, with the parent dataset stored on NYC Open Data. The data that we analyzed contained columns related adopted dog breed type, dog name, gender, birth month, and license issue and expiration dates. Our primary objective questions we were looking to answer were: 

1. Is there a correlation between location (borough) and dog breed?
2. Can we predict dog breed or dog name for each neighborhood?
3. Do more dogs tend to be adopted in more affluent boroughs/census tracts?

Ultimately, we found that there *is* a correlation between location and dog breed, there is a small percent likelihood we could accurately predict dog name and dog breed, and dogs tend to be adopted across more of middle-class households as opposed to higher class folks.
